monolith-emptybubble
============

Intro
-----

Monolith is an SDK to build interactive bubbles in Rocket.Chat
environment. The following document explains how to install and use
Monolith SDK. It provides code snippet and examples on how to create a
custom bubble on Rocket.chat using the SDK. There are 4 repositories
containing relevant code:

-   **monolith-sdk**\
    It contains the code for the SDK. Here core funtionalities are
    provided. All other packages depends on this.\
    <https://github.com/ObelixSWE/monolith-sdk>\
    This package includes some built-in bubbles:

    -   **CurrencyBubble**\
        This bubble allows to convert monetary values from one currency
        to another.

    -   **PollBubble**\
        This bubble allows to make a survey.

    -   **RandomBubble**\
        This bubble allow to roll a dice.

-   **monolith-hellobubble**\
    It contains the code for the simplest example possible of how to use
    Monolith-SDK.\
    <https://github.com/ObelixSWE/monolith-hellobubble>

-   **monolith-demo**\
    It contains the code for the official Monolith Demo. It represents a
    more complex use case than monolith-hello. See description for
    details.\
    <https://github.com/ObelixSWE/monolith-demo>

-   **monolith-emptybubble**\
    It contains the code for the empty bubble i.e. a set of files you
    can use to start to build your own bubble. See the developer guide
    for details.\

New bubble creation
===================

A new bubble from an empty bubble
---------------------------------

monolith-emptybubble is provided as a starting point to develop a new
bubble. The first thing to do is to choose a name for your bubble. From
now will be used \<yourbubble\> to indicate your project. Once you
downloaded the directory modify files as follow:

-   rename the main directory and all files to a different name such it
    includes \<yourbubble\>

-   **package.js**

    -   change package name to \<yourbubble\> in Package.describe name.

    -   substitute empty with \<yourbubble\> in api.addFiles

-   **client/main.js**: correct file path

-   **server/main.js**: correct file path

-   **server/Methods.js**: write your own Meteor.method. It is required
    for update but is optional for insertion. Usage is explained in
    section *Database configuration and possible uses*

-   **lib/emptyDb.js**: rename the collection using \<yourbubble\>

-   **lib/emptyCheck.js**: rename the check object and insert your data
    schema as described in *Data schema description*

-   **lib/emptyBubble.jsx**: Gui component. See *Gui requirement* for
    details.

-   **lib/emptyBubbleConfig.jsx**: Gui component. See *Gui requirement*
    for details.

-   **lib/emptyBubbleCreationButton.jsx**: Gui component. See *Gui
    requirement* for details.

-   **lib/emptyCreator.jsx**: substitute empty for \<yourbubble\>. This
    file is required to integrate your graphical elements with
    monolith’s gui.

Keep in mind that names you gave here need to precise. Monolith relies
on that.

Gui requirements
----------------

These are the gui components you must realize to obtain a bubble. You
can ease your work using the component library provided with Monolith.

### emptyBubble.jsx

You can realize up to 2 versione of this, for sender and for receiver,
or just use one as in examples. Just modify accordingly
\<yourbubble\>Creator.js.

You have to realize a React component that will receive in props all
database data for that bubble. If you need to modify bubble server
status you’ll have to use \<yourbubble\>Db.

### emptyBubbleConfig.jsx

You have to realize a React component that will receive in props a
*closeMenu* function. Use this to close menu when finished to configure
your bubble like this:

        send(){
            let insProm = <yourbubble>Db.insert({...});
            insProm.then(
                (result) => {this.props.closeMenu();},
                (error) => {console.log(error);}
            );
        }

The example uses the promise syntax. If operation succeedes the menu is
closed.

To insert a bubble into server side database you’ll have to use
\<yourbubble\>Db.

### emptyBubbleCreationButton.jsx

This is the button in the menu to start to configure \<yourbubble\>. For
a basic usage you can simply insert \<yourbubble\> in the given file.

If you need two button (like monolith-demo) you can redefine the method
*secondAreaName* (commented in empty). You also have to pass as props
*secondButtonName*. Note that you will need a second configmenu and
creator named accordingly.

Data schema description
-----------------------

In \<yourbubble\>Check.js you have to define a schema to validate data
you put in database. Define it with SimpleSchema syntax:
<https://www.npmjs.com/package/simpl-schema>

Database configuration and possible uses
----------------------------------------

In \<yourbubble\>Db.js you simply have to insert the correct name for
your bubble. In \<yourbubble\>Methods.js you can insert you can put
Meteor methods to be called at insertion or update of bubble:

#### Method for insertion

*Use is optional.*

    newDataObj method(dataObj);

This alters the data Object sent from client before it is checked. Note
the modified object must be returned. Call it by inserting the method’s
name as argument of \<yourbubble\>Db.

#### Method for update

*Use is mandatory.*

    boolean method(bubbleId, argument);

In this method you have to put all database update operation for
\<yourbubble\>. It must return true for success, false for failure. Call
it by inserting the method’s name as argument of \<yourbubble\>Db.
